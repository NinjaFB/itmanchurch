# Rules
1. We have to pray to the IT man once every hour from 8am to 3pm for at least 10 minutes at the nearest computer.
2. The amount of sleep one gets should be minimal
3. One must jeer and recoil in disgust whenever someone mentions MacOS (boo, *recoils in disgust*)
4. Toilet Rules
  1. When you use the toilet, lock the door, even in your own home.
  2. Flush once immediately following your poop, and again after you've wiped.
  3. One can wipe sitting or standing, whichever they prefer, except in the case of an automatic flushing toilet. In such cases, one must sit and wipe or risk constant flushing
  4. One should wash their appendages, for the IT man's glory. Upon rinsing the soap off one's hands, one should snip snip their fingers, shake their hands twelve times, then use a small piece of paper towel, folded in half, to dry their hands. The IT man demands you be eco friendly
  5. One should pee sitting down. It's cleaner for everybody, and you're not the one cleaning the toilet, I am.
5. One may follow more than one religion.
6. All those who join are required to read the [origin](/origin)
