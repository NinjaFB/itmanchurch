# Rules about Toilets
  1. When you use the toilet, lock the door, even in your own home.
  2. Flush once immediately following your poop, and again after you've wiped. 
  3. One can wipe sitting or standing, whichever they prefer, except in the case of an automatic flushing toilet. In such cases, one must sit and wipe or risk constant flushing
  4. One should wash their appendages, for the IT man's glory. Upon rinsing the soap off one's hands, one should snip snip their fingers, shake their hands twelve times, then use a small piece of paper towel, folded in half, to dry their hands. The IT man demands you be eco friendly
  5. One should pee sitting down. It's cleaner for everybody, and you're not the one cleaning the toilet, I am.
